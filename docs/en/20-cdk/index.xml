      <title>CDK Module Overview</title>

      <description>Welcome to the .NET AWS CDK module of the workshop! &amp;ldquo;CDK&amp;rdquo; stands for Cloud Development Kit.
Workshop Goals The goal of this lab is to guide participants through adding support for MySQL database to both ASP.NET application codebase, and to the existing infra-as-code C# CDK projects defining cloud CI/CD pipeline and cloud application deployment environment.
This workshop skips the &amp;ldquo;Hello, World&amp;rdquo; CDK project creation, and instead focuses on somewhat more in-depth capabilities of the CDK, showing higher-fidelity code samples implementing closer-to-real-life scenarios.</description>

      <description>You may skip this page and move on to the next step and you are using Amazon-supplied VM image (AMI) at an Amazon event, with all tools installed and pre-configured.
Pre-Requisites  Either MS SQL Server (LocalDB version is perfectly suitable), or PostgreSQL, per Common Prerequisites. MySQL is required as the goal of the module is to add MySQL support to the app. MySQL Workbench, a MySQL management UI console, is recommended.</description>

      <description>Starting Unicorn Store Web Application     Notes      Once you have prepared your development environment, the only thing remains is to ensure that UnicornStore.csproj is selected as a startup project, switch hosting from &amp;ldquo;IIS Express&amp;rdquo; to Console, as shown on the screenshot on the left, and start the application in the debug mode.    After debugging session has started, a command console window will open first with application console output in it, along with a web browser window, showing the home page of the Unicorn Store ASP.</description>

      <title>Creating AWS CI/CD Pipeline</title>
      <link>/en/20-cdk/40-creating-ci-cd-pipeline.html</link>

      <guid>/en/20-cdk/40-creating-ci-cd-pipeline.html</guid>
      <description>Before we dive into the code base of the Unicorn Store solution and start hacking it, let&amp;rsquo;s spend a few moments to create the CI/CD pipeline in AWS, as creating it takes a few minutes to complete, and while that is in progress, we&amp;rsquo;ll spend some time looking into the structure of project and getting familiar with CDK concepts.
    Notes      Again, please select either Posgres or SQL Server configuration from Solution&amp;rsquo;s Build Configuration drop-down in Visual Studio&amp;hellip;    &amp;hellip;and mark &amp;ldquo;CicdInfraAsCode&amp;rdquo; project as a startup project.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s use the few minutes that it takes for the application CI/CD pipeline infrastructure to build, to get familiar with the structure of the project.
    Notes      Solution contains one ASP.NET Core application project named UnicornStore, and three CDK-related projects: CdkLib - a C# class library project, containing reusable components shared between two executable CDK projects.    The first of executable CDK projects is CicdInfraAsCode - the project we ran at the previous step of the lab.</description>
