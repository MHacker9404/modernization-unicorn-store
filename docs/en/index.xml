      <description>.NET developers, especially those writing web applications, are those who will benefit most from using this workshop. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be seasoned engineer though to learn and enjoy from this content: even an intermediate or an ambitious beginner should have no trouble working through the most labs.
Other technical roles, like Architects, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineers, with some familiarity with .NET software development ecosystem, should also have easy time following lab steps and learning how a run-of-the-mill ASP.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the .NET AWS CDK module of the workshop! &amp;ldquo;CDK&amp;rdquo; stands for Cloud Development Kit.
Workshop Goals The goal of this lab is to guide participants through adding support for MySQL database to both ASP.NET application codebase, and to the existing infra-as-code C# CDK projects defining cloud CI/CD pipeline and cloud application deployment environment.
This workshop skips the &amp;ldquo;Hello, World&amp;rdquo; CDK project creation, and instead focuses on somewhat more in-depth capabilities of the CDK, showing higher-fidelity code samples implementing closer-to-real-life scenarios.</description>

      <description>ASP.NET Application The foundation of every module here is an ASP.NET Core Unicorn Store web application that has an MVC/Razor UI and MVC Controllers implementing business logic and data access layers. Unicorn Store application is based on an established ASP.NET Music Store sample and thus should be fairly familiar to many participants.
Data Access components of the application are written using code-first style, enabling easy switching of the DAL from using SQL Server to other RDBMS, including open-source databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.</description>
