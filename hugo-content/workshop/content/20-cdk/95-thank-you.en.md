This concludes the CDK module of the workshop. Thank you very much for your participation! We hope you have learned something new and useful today, and would not mind to let us know what we could improve.

Feel free to explore further the codebase of all CDK projects to understand better the ins and outs of how to start building your own AWS infrastructure using all great features of C#.

Please don't forget to [clean up](./99-cleanup.html) AWS resources created in the course of this lab! Doing that is especially *important if you are using personal or corporate AWS Account*, to ensure no unexpected charges are made for resources you have created.
