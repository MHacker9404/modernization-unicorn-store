This chapter will guide you through the process of adding support for [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to the Unicorn Store application and to infra-as-code projects. `MySQL` is an open source, cross-platform, relational database that can be run in a cloud, on premises, or locally on developer workstation free of charge.

This set of steps builds on the existing, multi-database-friendly architecture of the Unicorn Store application, which already supports MS SQL Server and open-source PostgreSQL, while requiring only modest changes to the code of executable projects in the Solution.
